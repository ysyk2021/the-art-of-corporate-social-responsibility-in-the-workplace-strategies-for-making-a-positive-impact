Filtering and Curating Information

Setting Clear Objectives and Priorities

Managing Information Consumption Habits

### Applying the 80/20 Rule

Introduce the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, in the context of information consumption. Encourage individuals to focus on the most critical and valuable information that will yield the greatest impact rather than attempting to absorb every piece of available information.

Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
